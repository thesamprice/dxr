DXR-py-MC
--About ---
This is a python model / controller for the DXR sqlite database.

--- Goals ---
The goal of this project is to use the sqlite database, and the model provided to generate different code wrappers, and documentation for source code.

---- My Goals ----
My goal is to generate the following items.
Command and Telemetry documentation based of C/C++ header files.
Command and Telemetry python CTYPES for use in a ground system.
Python CTypes wrappers to be used to unit test my applications.
	SWIG wrappers had an ugly interface for array's that I couldn't get to work.
